# tf-deep-evolution

Deep Neuroevolution with Tensorflow

## Description

A framework to design CNNs automatically through the use of a Grammatical Evolution algorithm.

## Requirements

* Tensorflow - powerful tool to built deep neural networks
* Keras - high level abstraction layer easily built CNNs

## Algorithms

* Grammar-based Genetic Programming algorithm
* Random Search

## Installation

Install external dependencies:

`python3 -m pip install -U scikit-image`

To test library: `python3 setup.py pytest`

To build library: `python3 setup.py  bdist_wheel`

To Install library: `pip3 install /path/to/cbioge/cbioge-X.X.-py3-none-any.whl`
